Semi-supervised learning offers a tantalising prospect - given the task of
prediction on a small labelled dataset, can we enhance the
performance of our prediction algorithm by training using a much larger
unlabelled dataset? In practice, such algorithms can yield mixed results for a
number of factors, but a recent paper analysing causal inference yields an
interesting insight into the practicality of application for certain problems.
